# currency-converter
## description
This program converts almost any currency. It uses https://wechselkurse-euro.de/ website, so you can convert only those currencies, which are available on that website.
## how it works
The program combines data from two websites in order to store information about country name, currency name, currency symbol and exchange rate. It enables the user to choose between three options, i.e. printing an exchange rate table on the screen, converting one currency to another and writing an exchange rate table into a .csv file.
## language comments
There is only a Polish version of the program available. German and English version are under construction.
